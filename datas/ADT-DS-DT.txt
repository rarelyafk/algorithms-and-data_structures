Abstract Data Type
Defines contractual agreement for behavior and state management
Abstract Data Types exists only conceptually.
They have no concrete existence in the context of a language.
This is why Wikipedia refers to it specifically as a mathematical model.

Data Structure
Class level implementation of the contract defined by an abstract data type.
Data Structures exists in the form of the code that comprises your class definition.

Data Type
Concrete instance of a class
Data Types exists in the form of objects created from classes you defined.

Examples
A Priority Queue is an abstract data type which can be implemented with a Binary Heap data structure.
A List is an abstract data type that can be implemented with an array or linked list data struture

TLDR
Abstract Data Type > Data Structure > Data Type
